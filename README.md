# Titanic-Classification
A data science project that focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic during the tragic disaster. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.
The predictive model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

cases, it is observed that passengers from higher socio-economic classes (e.g., 1st class), females, and children had higher survival rates compared to those from lower classes, males, and adults. These patterns reflect the "women and children first" policy followed during the Titanic's evacuation.

Overall, the Titanic classification problem provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the tragic event and showcases the application of machine learning in historical data analysis.
